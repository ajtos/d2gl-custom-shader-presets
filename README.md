Additional slang shader presets for D2GL

## Scaling in D2GL

Recently **bayaraa** introduced support for multi-pass shaders in [D2GL](https://github.com/bayaraa/d2gl). [cnc-ddraw](https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw) had basic support for single-pass shaders for quite some time, so what really changed? *D2GL* offers HD text, which means that text is rendered separately. This means we aren't concerned with text readability and shaders can be pushed a bit harder without sacrifices. Moreover due to multi-pass support combining shaders gives more options.
